## Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Carlos. Iâ€™m from Argentina and Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer.

- I worked, among other things, designing and developing mechanical test equipament.

- Lately I have been interested in robotics and in the study of ML techniques for industrial and scientific applications. 

- Right now, Iâ€™m starting a project to develop PINN models for piping subject vibrations. Throughout 2024 there will be new developments in [@teknais-dev](https://github.com/teknais-dev).
